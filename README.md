# About

This is a fun kids app using **React hooks** only (using React Context instead of a state library) and **TypeScript**, which is **fully responsive** and working on Desktop and mobile (touch interaction).

See the app [HERE](https://sarabon.github.io/kids-animal-app/).


The app is for learning animal sounds and animal habitat.
